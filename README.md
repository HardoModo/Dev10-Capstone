## Project Overview

The relationship between food consumption and health is a topic of significant importance in today's society. The nutritional composition of foods plays a crucial role in determining their impact on our overall well-being. In this report, we will analyze the nutrient composition of various food groups using food datasets sourced online. By examining key factors such as energy content, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and other essential nutrients, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between food and health outcomes.
